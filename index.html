			<p>This is my first project for my ITMD (web development) class! I am utilizing html to create a basic website with videos, pictures and links.</p>
			<p>I originally wanted to go into medicine and become a doctor, I even went to a medical based high school. However, in my junior year of high school a new coding club was set up at my school.</p>
			<p>I was curious and joined it alongside one of my friends, it was a class about creating basic java for video games and I really enjoyed it.</p>
			<p>With my peers we were able to make a very basic maze game with the help of our instructors, that is when I decided to change my career-path to tech.</p>
			<p>When I got to university I decided to major in computer science, it ws very different from the previous experience I had with coding and was less fun and a lot more math-based.</p>
			<p>I was not secure about the major I had chosen and my roommate recommended I transfer to another, after some research I landed on Game Design and made my switch.</p>
