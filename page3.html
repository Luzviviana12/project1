			<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I really enjoy music and love to listen to different styles of it, some of my faverites are indie, early 2000's reggeaton and pop, and I'm currently going through a norteno phase of music. Music is a very big aspect of my culture and of me as a person, I listen to music all the time and also enjoy collecting posters, vinyls, and going to concerts/music festivals.</p>
				<p>I collect vinyls and posters from all different genres (mainly spanish and indie) though, recently I began collecting vintage mexican vinyls from about the 70s-90s. Where I live there are a lot of record shops and I frequent eBay to find new vintage vinyls for sale.</p>
				<p>Here are some pictures of my posters and vinyls. :)</p>
